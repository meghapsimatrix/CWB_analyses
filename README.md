# Replication Materials for 'Cluster Wild Bootstrapping to Handle Dependent Effect Sizes in Meta-Analysis with a Small Number of Studies'

-   Replication code for Study 1 can be found in [simulation_code/sim_code_study_1](https://github.com/meghapsimatrix/CWB_analyses/tree/main/simulation_code/sim_code_study_1) and [simulation_code/sim_code_study_1\_EDT](https://github.com/meghapsimatrix/CWB_analyses/tree/main/simulation_code/sim_code_study_1_EDT). We added the EDT method to Study 1 after running simulation on all other methods; thus, the code for Study 1 is in two folders. We ran the simulation in Stampede2 supercomputer provided by [Texas Advanced Computer Center](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/). The simulation code consists of a bash file to run the code in the supercomputer.

-   Replication code for Study 2 can be found in [simulation_code/sim_code_study_2](https://github.com/meghapsimatrix/CWB_analyses/tree/main/simulation_code/sim_code_study_2).

-   The results from the two studies can be found in [results](https://github.com/meghapsimatrix/CWB_analyses/tree/main/results).

-   Replication code to create the graphs for the main text and the supplementary text can be found in [results_analysis_code](https://github.com/meghapsimatrix/CWB_analyses/tree/main/results_analysis_code).

-   The png files for the graphs used in the paper can be found in [graphs_paper](https://github.com/meghapsimatrix/CWB_analyses/tree/main/graphs_paper).

-   Replication code for the applied analysis example presented in the main text can be found in [applied_analysis_paper](https://github.com/meghapsimatrix/CWB_analyses/tree/main/applied_analysis_paper).
